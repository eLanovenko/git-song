I don't even know the time
When I saw you baby
When I took my single chance
With my heart and lost it

And you were more than pretty lover
And it was more to be forgotten
U didn't have any rules
And now I know what it means


So long, I don't need nobody
So long, Ever since I loved u
So long, I don't need nobody
So long, Ever since I loved u
